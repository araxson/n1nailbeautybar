Amazing experience at N1 Nail Beauty Bar! They did an incredible job on my nails, and the photos I‚Äôm sharing are from my girlfriend‚Äôs nails, which they also did. The staff went above and beyond, they even treated me to a wax glove hand massage and a chair massage. Everyone was so friendly and professional. We both left feeling completely pampered. Highly recommend!

Had such a great experience at the salon today! Jessica and her staff were so warm, welcoming, and professional. They did a beautiful job on my nails and were so sweet and patient while doing my daughter‚Äôs as well. She felt so special and left with the biggest smile!

The salon itself is clean, stylish, and relaxing. You can really tell they use high-quality, luxurious products that make the experience feel extra special. Thank you for the amazing service. We‚Äôll definitely be back!

I absolutely adore Jessica and this is my favourite little hidden gem in Calgary. This is the only place I will go for a Japanese Head Spa. You get a private room with high quality shampoo and they properly dry your hair before you leave. They do a phenomenal job with your nails too and the decor is beautiful! Love!

The customer service I received at N1 Nail Beauty Bar was absolutely top notch! Before even booking the appointment I got to talk through all the services they offered and pick what was right for me. I wanted to get my nails done to match my outfit since I was a bridesmaid at my friends wedding, and they went so far as to find the perfect colour to match! I am very glad I booked in early and gave them the chance to ensure that my design idea had the right colours. I was in there for a few hours getting everything done (pedicure, manicure and a scalp massage clean and facial) and they made sure I was always comfortable and offered me refreshments throughout. All in all, fantastic experience, above and beyond customer service.

Jessica, Ann, and Cadie took such great care of us from the moment we walked in the door. They greeted us with water and coffee and made sure we were comfortable. They care deeply about your nail health and making sure everything is just how you like it. By far the most relaxing pedicure I‚Äôve ever had. The treatment here is unlike anywhere I‚Äôve been in Calgary. I highly recommend booking an appointment here!

The ladies in this salon are very knowledgeable of their craft. Top notch customer service, cozy ambiance, great selection of colors and very open to requests/preferences, very clean salon too. I wanted a squarish oval nail shape and Menah did it perfectly, more than I expected actually. I will surely recommend them and will definitely be back!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I had such an amazing experience at N1 Nail Beauty Bar! Teresa is an outstanding nail tech. She‚Äôs super efficient, detail-oriented, and genuinely cares about her work. She was so friendly and made sure I loved the final design. Jessica, the owner, went out of her way to make me feel welcome, and the whole place has such a cozy, clean, and inviting vibe. The design and perfection has been fantastic, which speaks to the quality of their work. It‚Äôs absolutely worth every penny! I highly recommend N1 Nail Beauty Bar if you‚Äôre looking for top-notch service and a relaxing, enjoyable experience.

I had originally given this salon 5 stars but I would like to retract it. This is due to no fault of the nail tech (Gabbie), but due to the owners deciding to let her go. I will no longer be going here.
When the owner invited me to try her salon, she convinced me to go by showing me GABBIE‚Äôs work.
I will admit that they gave me a discount for going there. I had to switch from acrylic to gel and the cost was going to be out of my price range. However, this was a discount that they didn‚Äôt even inform Gabbie about and she spent literal hours doing a service at a lower price, that she didn‚Äôt even agree to.
This salon is on the other side of the city from where I live and is incredibly inconvenient for me to go to. The only reason I kept going is because of Gabbie.

I understand that there are two sides to every story and that I may not have all of the information. I don‚Äôt care what their reason for letting her go was though.
The bottom line is that I continued to go because I love Gabbie‚Äôs work. Therefore, I will no longer be supporting this business, since she is not there anymore.

\*Edited in response to owner

Not sure why you would even write this knowing that I not only texted you the proof with documents I also send them to your Instagram DM and once you receive them you blocked me. You have my number aswell my Instagram and as stated in the text I sent you months ago my refund can be sent to the email I provided aswell I also stated you could let me know when I could pick it up. Reviews are here for a reason why I'm adding to my experience. Don't see why yr dragging this out all you had to do was refund me last year. IM STILL WAITING...

Awful attitudes of owner and husband, they took my rent money and closed their shop to do renovation without any notice and once opened they refused to repay my stolen rent money for the month. Once I provided evidence of the contract they signed with the previous owners they bought from I was blocked on all platforms which is why this review is needed. They were provided with all the details to refund me and refused to do so. UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS AND ATTITUDES
